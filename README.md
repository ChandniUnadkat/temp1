Software required for the system to run
---------------------------------------
Sqlite3               -       Used for storing data
Sublime Text 3        -       Used for generating all computer codes
Git (Version 1.9.5)   -       Used for connection with GitHub server

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the files necessary to run the system are in the repository called "temp1" (https://github.com/ChandniUnadkat/temp1.git).

The system allows only .csv files to be uploaded (validation via JavaScript) and extracts the data from the .csv file into SQLite3. The user is then able to view the uploaded data from the database.

(Note: For security purposes, the system will notify a warning message if no file is uploaded and upload button is clicked).
